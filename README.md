# Image-Recreation-by-Polygon-Optimisation
The goal is to approximate images using a limited set of geometric shapes. Specifically, we want to develop a pipeline that, given a source image and a set of constraints (such as the types of allowed shapes, a minimum or maximum number of shapes, or the number of colours), can efficiently generate an SVG image that closely resembles the original.
